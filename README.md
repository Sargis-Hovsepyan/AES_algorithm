## AUA CS 215 Projec: AES Algorithm Implementation

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in C++.
AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure communication and data protection. This implementation covers both 
encryption and decryption processes, allowing users to integrate AES encryption into their C++ applications.
