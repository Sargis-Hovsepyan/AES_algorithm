# Oblivious Transfer (1-out-2)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a basic 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer (OT)
protocol. The program consists of a Sender and a Receiver class, showcasing the flow of the 
OT protocol using two messages and a choice.

## Program Flow

 * The program initializes an RSA object.
 * Two messages (message_0 and message_1) and a choice (choice) are defined.
 * Sender and Receiver objects are instantiated.
 * Random messages (x_0 and x_1) are generated by the sender, and blind encryption (v) is performed by the receiver.
 * Values of x_0, x_1, and v are printed to the console.
 * Sender sends messages based on the receiver's vector v, and the receiver chooses the appropriate message.
 * Messages sent by the sender (m_0 and m_1) and the message chosen by the receiver are printed to the console.

## Output

The program outputs demonstrate the 1-out-of-2 OT protocol, including the original messages,
random messages (x_0 and x_1), the blinded encryption vector (v), messages sent by the sender,
and the message chosen by the receiver.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to better understand or extend the 1-out-of-2
Oblivious Transfer protocol implementation in C++.

## Usage

* Place this Makefile in the same directory as your source files.
* Ensure that the source files are in the sources/ directory
* Run `make` to compile the program.
* Execute the compiled program with `./oblivious_transfer`.
